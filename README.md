# RotorIy : Rotor Identification with IMU using geometric algebra

A rotor estimation program using geometric algebra computation done with the base library generated by Gaigen2.5 GA implementation generator.

The current version is experimental.

The associated main.cpp is only a sample and isn't intended to the real one, though it's tested with hachidori/bee3b WiFi remote sensor. The files prefixed c3ga except c3ga.xml are generated by Gaigen2.5. The identification is done with RotorIy files.

The rotor identification is based on the method proposed at
